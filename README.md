# SupportAI_Evolution
An attempt at creating a support AI in Java that can work on multiple game systems with minimal to no reprogramming.

The main aim is to create an AI that is independant of any player, and becomes a full player in and of itself (something far more than a way to get around anti-cheat EULA's.)

Any deployment of this software is for testing purposes, and not only not meant for providing an edge to human-played accounts, but also that reasonable attempts are taken to ensure that no human-played account retains a net-benefit from the usage of this experiment.
